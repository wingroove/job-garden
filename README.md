# README

A pictoral representation of a job search. Users can input data about potential jobs, and depending upon the stage that the user is in the interview process, pictures of plants will change. The further along a user gets, the larger the indiviual plant will "grow". If a user is no longer in consideration for a particular job, the plant will be topped with an image of a flower. A job offer will be topped with a fruit. 

Individual plots can diplay further details about a job by rolling over a given plant. 

Currently, plants are organized solely by when they are added to the database. My hope is to allow users to organize the garden based on time, job status, company name, or job title.

My next step will be working on this organization, then on further developing the aesthetic of the "new", "details, and "edit" pages. Following that I will update the gifs and the aethetics of the main garden page.
